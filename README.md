## Capstone-Project-1
# Denver 2016 Bike Share

### Project Summary
This project was undertaken to fulfill one of the two Capstone projects required by [SpringBoard.com](https://springboard.com). It explores the Denver 2016 Bike Share Trips dataset and follows up with regression and classification analytics deploying several popular machine learning algorithms.
### Project Files
The following project files are located in this project directory:

[README.md](https://github.com/hbhasin/Capstone-Project-1/blob/master/README.md) -- This document, with project description.
goal of this Capstone project is to explore the available data using popular data visualizations tools such as [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com), [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), and [D3js](https://d3js.org/), and predict ridership using weather and time of day using a linear model such as linear regressor and non-linear classifier models such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
### Client
[Denver B-cycle](http://www.denverbcycle.com) and [Boulder B-cycle]( https://boulder.bcycle.com) are the clients for this project. According to [Bicycling]( http://www.bicycling.com/culture/news/the-50-best-bike-cities-of-2016), Denver and Boulder were among the 50 best bike cities of 2016. Naturally, both cities would like to see increased ridership year by year. Studying past trends and predicting future trends would benefit and assist these cities in planning their systems more effectively and efficiently.
### Data
There are datasets for both Denver and Boulder bicycle trips that go as far back as 2010. The most recent datasets available are for 2015. It may be possible that data for 2016 might be posted on their websites in time for use in this project.
### Data Acquisition
Data will be collected from the publicly available datasets and merged with geo-spatial information from [Google Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/) and weather data from [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/) for data wrangling and munging. The data will be explored for ridership trends using data visualization tools as described above. Data from 2015 (or 2016, if available) will be scoped for use in training, validating and testing the linear and non-linear machine learning models.	
### Deliverables
Python code, Report, Slide Deck to be posted on Github.
