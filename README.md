# Denver 2016 Bike Share

## Project Summary
This project was undertaken to fulfill one of the two Capstone projects required by [SpringBoard.com](https://springboard.com). It explores the Denver 2016 Bike Share Trips dataset and follows up with regression and classification analytics deploying several popular machine learning algorithms.

## Data Sources
[Denver B-cycle](https://www.denverbcycle.com/company) - The Trips dataset is located under [Denver B-cycle Trip Data](http://denver.bcycle.com/docs/librariesprovider34/default-document-library/2016denverbcycletripdata_public.xlsx?sfvrsn=2). The Kiosk dataset is located under [Denver B-Cycle Station Location Data](https://denver.bcycle.com/docs/librariesprovider34/default-document-library/october2016_kioskinfo.xlsx?sfvrsn=2).

Distances between Checkout and Return Kiosks: Distances were retrieved from [Google Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/) using Python 3.6 script.

Weather Data: Retrieved from [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/) using Python 2.7 scripts.

Geo-spatial Mapping: [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/) was used to map the number of bike checkouts and returns by kiosks.

## Analysis Software
All data analyses were done in Python and with publicly available libraries using Jupyter Notebook and IDLE except for the geo-spatial mapping of the number of bike checkouts and returns by kiosks which was done using Tableau.

## Acknowledgements
The original plan was to use the Denver 2015 Trips dataset to continue the work by [Tyler Byers](https://github.com/tybyers/denver_bcycle). Fortunately, the 2016 dataset became available just in time for this project's undertaking. While there are certainly some differences between how the data were analyzed and reported by Denver B-Cycle and the author, credit must go to Denver B-Cycle for publishing its [2016 annual report](http://denver.bcycle.com/docs/librariesprovider34/default-document-library/dbs_annualreport_2016_05.pdf?sfvrsn=2) and posting the 2016 dataset for public consumption and for use in this project in a timely and professional manner. Credit also goes to my mentor, [Alex Chao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexchao56/) for his invaluable guidance and feedback on the progress of this project.
